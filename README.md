This repository implements multimodal data fusion methods for analyzing complex biomedical data. Our approach combines multiple data modalities including functional MRI (fMRI) as functional connectivity matrices, morphometric features, and lipid intensity measurements derived from the coordinates of selected brain regions and T1-weighted signal intensity were integrated to improve diagnostic accuracy and schizophrenia biomarkers analysis.

## Interconnections analysis between functional connectivity and brain lipidomic data
Hypothesis: Differences in myelin lipid intensity level could influence on fMRI signals related to neural activity
This analysis implements a comprehensive lipidomic correlation framework to identify schizophrenia biomarkers through regional lipid expression patterns. The pipeline generates correlation matrices for significant lipids across brain regions for both healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia patients (SZ), then calculates difference matrices (HC - SZ) to identify group-specific alterations.

Statistical significance is established through permutation testing with 10,000 iterations, where correlation coefficients are compared against null distributions generated by randomly shuffling matrix columns. 

KDE plots visualize the distributions of original correlations (orange) versus permutation-derived null correlations (blue), with significance thresholds set at 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. The analysis identified 149 statistically significant lipids in the COBRE dataset, with hypergeometric testing revealing 14 consistently positive correlations (p = 3.87×10⁻¹⁰) and 20 consistently negative correlations (p = 2.97×10⁻⁸) across the dataset. 

Positive correlations indicate coordinated inflammatory processes involving phospholipids, ceramides, and plasmalogens, suggesting neuroinflammation-related alterations in neurotransmitter balance and neural excitability. Negative correlations highlight disrupted myelin integrity through altered sphingomyelins, cholesteryl esters, and other myelin-associated lipids, potentially leading to compromised white matter function and reduced inter-regional communication characteristic of schizophrenia pathophysiology.
